MMC tools (mmc-utils)
=====================

mmc-utils is a tool for configuring MMC storage devices from userspace.

Contribution guidelines
-----------------------

The project works using a mailing list patch submission process, similar to the
process used for the Linux kernel itself.

One can document themselves by reading how to submit a patch in the official
Linux kernel documentation:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html

Not all sections apply but it should be a good way to get started.

A patch should be sent as a mail (not as an attachement, see documentation
above) to the linux-mmc@vger.kernel.org mailing list with maintainers as
Cc recipients.

Rust version
-------------
A Rust version of mmc-utils is available in the mmc-utils-rust directory.
To build the Rust version, navigate to the mmc-utils-rust directory and run:
cd mmc-utils-rust
cargo build --release
The compiled binary will be in target/release/mmc-utils-rust.
prior to building the Rust version, you will need to build the library version of mmc_cmd:
make -f Makefile.libmmc_cmd
This is because the Rust version of mmc-utils uses the current C implementation of mmc-utils to interact with the MMC device.
As we go forward, we will be replacing the C implementation with a Rust implementation.
